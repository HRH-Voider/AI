    "The empirical probability of winning exactly 2 out of 5 rounds of blackjack is around 34%. The theoretical probability of winning 2/5 rounds assuming a 25% win rate is 26%. The theoretical mean of this is 1.25. The empirical and theoretical probabilities are different due to the number of trials ran and the fact that the assumed chance of winning a round of blackjack is likely different from the actual \"true\" probability of winning a round, this is because I got my assumed probability from a friend, the actual probability might be much higher, with some sources claiming it's around 42%."
